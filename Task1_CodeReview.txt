Task 1:
1) In line number 53 of UserService.java, as userIds is a list but everytime only the 0th index value is getting fetched. 
   So change the line to userReturnList.add(mapper.read(userIds.get(i))); which will fetch and adds all the users from userIds 
   list to userReturnList linkedlist.
2) In line numbers 44, 62 an 72 of UserService.java, NotFoundExceptions are thrown but not handled by the calling functions
   in UserEndPoint.java
3) It is better to have logger messages in every method using the function log.info();, as it will help to keep track of and resolves
   any issues that comes in the production. 
4) In line number 48, the path should not have an action mentioned in the endpoint. 
5) In UserService.java, every method call to the database must be enclosed with try, catch blocks and proper exceptions must be 
caught.
